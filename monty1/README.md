This is a directory containing project with implementation of stacks and Queues in C programming commonly known as LIFO & FIFO to the problem set. Am working on an environment configured with UBUNTU 20.4 orchestration. 
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
